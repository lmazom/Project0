4. What I want

From any of them you can navegate to the other 3 ones.
In the File#3 I have two list, one ordered and one unordered.
In the File#4 I have a table.
I have images in the first 3 ones.
I inclue the Stylesheet with CSS properties, selectors and all the requiered elements.
I am using Bootstrap 4 in files #1 and #3 and have grid model.
I am using SCSS variables in File#1. The original SCSS file is called Var.scss and it was converted to the Var.css file.
